Haskell lists contain an indefinite number of elements of a single type. 
It is sometimes useful to create list-like functions that accept an indefinite
number of parameters of multiple types. These are called polyvariadic 
functions.

PolyToMonoid provides two polyvariadic functions, 'ptm' and 'ctm', as well as a 
typeclass 'Monoidable'. The only precondition is that the parameters of 'ptm'
and 'ctm' can be mapped to an underlying monoid using the 'toMonoid' function
provided by 'Monoidable'.
